# 100 days of ML

**My week 1/15(100 day of ML)**

During this week I learned so many thing about linear Algebra.
Some of the highlights are: 
1. Vector (Addition, subtraction,multiplication by a Scalar) Representation on a Graph.
2. Unit Vectors
3. 2&3D real coordinate Space
4. Spans
5. Linear Dependence
6. Subspace
7. Cool things about Matrix
I referred Khan Academy(this was my first time) and I love how they teach. 
They made it some simple with visual graphical representation.

**Week - 2/15 ( 100 days of ML )**

This whole week is kind of different.
Instead of learning formulaes, I learned how they come in first place.
Some of the highlights are:
1. How area of circle = Ï€r^2
2. Area under graph
3. What is derivative ( how d(x^n)/dt = nx^n-1 )
4. Chain Rule
5. Fundamental theorem of calcus
6. Taylor series

I referred 3Blue1Brown - Essence of Calcus and some blogs on medium, on particular topics.

**Week - 3/15  ( 100 days of ML )**

During this week Learned about Probability.
Some of the highlights are:
1. Random Variables
2. Sample Space
3. Event
4. Probability Distribution
5. Disjoint and Non disjoint events
6. Marginal, joint and conditional probability
7. Bayes Theorem.( Little bit of hands on with Python - Spam Filtering data visualization).
This week I have gone through some books and blogs.

**Week - 4/15 ( 100 days of ML )**

This week is all about Statistics.
Some highlights are:
1. Inferential Statistics
2. Central Limit Theorem
3. Hypothesis Testing 
        1. Null Hypothesis
        2. Alternate Hypothesis
4. Errors in Hypothesis Testing
5. ANOVA( Analysis of Variance)
6. Regression
7. R-Square
8. Correlation coefficient
Resources used : Analytics Vidhya, medium blogs and YouTube.

**Week - 5 / 15 (100 days of ML)**

I have decided to dedicate this month for Python
In the past few days I have brushed my existing knowledge of Python and now I am diving deep into Particular libraries.
So far I have explored.
1. Python Basics
2. Python for Data Analysis
   ```
        1. Numpy
        2. Panda's
        ```
3. Python for Data Visualization
     ```
        1. Matplotlib
        2. Seaborn
        ```
I am following a Course on Udemy named "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" By  Jose Portilla

**Week - 6 / 15 (100 days of ML)**

I have decided to dedicate this month for Python
In constitution to previous week, I have explored:

1. Python for Data Visualization
   ```
      1. Cufflinks
      2. Plotly
      3. Geographical Plotting.
     ```
2. Did some Data Analysis and Visualization on Datasets available on Kaggle.
3. I am maintaing a repo on Github do check this out https://github.com/aaavinash85/100-Days-of-ML-
